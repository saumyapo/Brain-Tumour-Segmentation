# Brain-Tumour-Segmentation
This is a side project to explore using U-Net Architecture to segment brain tumour images and is currently a work in progress.

## Overview:
1. The data used for this was obtained via [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) as part of research work done by [Dr. Jun Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e9yrvHEAAAAJ&hl=en) and his team.
2. The method used is described below but follows a basic workflow of employing U-Net to segment medical images.
