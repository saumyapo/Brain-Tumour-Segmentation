# Brain-Tumour-Segmentation
This is a side project to explore using U-Net Architecture to segment brain tumour images and is currently a work in progress.

## Overview:
1. The data used for this project was obtained via [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) as part of research work done by [Dr. Jun Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e9yrvHEAAAAJ&hl=en) and his team. The data was used in the following publications:
   *  [Cheng, Jun, et al. "Enhanced Performance of Brain Tumor Classification via Tumor Region Augmentation and Partition." PloS one 10.10 (2015).](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140381)
   *  [Cheng, Jun, et al. "Retrieval of Brain Tumors by Adaptive Spatial Pooling and Fisher Vector  Representation." PloS one 11.6 (2016).](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157112)

3. The method used is described below but follows a basic workflow of employing U-Net to segment black and white medical images.
